# Flytrap

Flytrap is an audio cloud-based service for the Borum Ecosystem. The app consists of four main features:

 - [x] The ability to upload audio files to your account
 
 - [ ] The ability to use simple audio editing tools such as trimming
 
 - [x] The ability to link and share these audio files
 
 - [ ] The ability to record audio directly

Google, Microsoft, and Apple give users the ability to store documents, spreadsheets, and slideshows quite effectively, but not one of them offers the service both at zero price, honors consumer privacy, and offers the product to users not already in that ecosystem. Flytrap uses some features of G Suite plus simple editing tools that Google Drive does not supply.

Flytrap is named after the [Venus Flytrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_flytrap) and is part of the Borum Ecosystem.
